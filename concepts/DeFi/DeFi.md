# Liquid Staking

- a rapidly growing solution for locking up a user's tokens and contributing to the security of proof of stake blockchains
- a software solution that enables users to stake directly on a proof of stake network such as Ethereum, **with a liquid staking token (LST)** programmatically minted by the protocol providing access to liquidity while the user stakes.
- In liquid staking, token holders stake their token and receive a receipt token, called a liquid staking token (LST), to evidence ownership of their staked token.
- The LST can be transferred, stored, traded, and utilized in DeFi or supported dapps.
