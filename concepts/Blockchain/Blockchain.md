A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers in a network. Every time a new set of transactions is added, its called a “block” - hence the name blockchain. Public blockchains like Ethereum allow anyone to add, but not remove, data. If someone wanted to alter any of the information or cheat the system, they’d need to do so on the majority of computers on the network. That is a lot! This makes decentralized blockchains like Ethereum highly secure.

a cryptographically secured, time-stamped, public and distributed database of every
[[transaction]] that has ever occurred on the network.

“Distributed” here means that the information in the blockchain is broadcast to and recorded by every node in the network. There is no one central database. Any user can refer to this list of transactions and check exactly what how many bitcoins have ever belonged to any specific [https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/bitcoin-address](https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/bitcoin-address) at any point in time. This way the system is transparent, double-spending is prevented, and there is no need for a trusted central authority.

The bitcoin blockchain is supported by the efforts of many miners: users who put computing power to the task of solving a mathematical problem that will reward them with bitcoins, while at the same time producing the hashes that secure the blocks of data in the chain. The hashes are cryptographically produced strings of data that make the info in the blockchain virtually impossible to tamper with. | [https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/blockchain](https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/blockchain) |

### 👝 Digital Wallet _(_`Wallet` _in Blockchain)_

- An electronic device, online service, or software program that allows one party to make electronic transactions with another party bartering digital currency units for goods and services.

- A digital wallet, also known as an e-wallet or mobile wallet, is an electronic device, online service, or software program that allows one party to make electronic transactions with another party bartering digital currency units for goods and services.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet)

- Money can be deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions or, in other cases, an individual's bank account can be linked to the digital wallet.

## Network

### 🌐 Mainnet

- deploy and service

### ☑️ Testnet

- develop, test and debug

### 💰 BitCoin

PoW 방식으로 구현한 최초의 암호 화폐. 새로운 블록을 추가하는 작업을 채굴이라 정의하고, 채굴에 성공한 이에게 비트코인을 지급한다. 암호화폐 확보를 목적으로 채굴 경쟁이 과열되며, 에너지를 지나치게 소모하는 합의 방식이라는 이미지를 얻게 되었다.

Distributed Ledger

# 📝 **Distributed ledger** _(in Computer Science)_

| A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger technology or DLT) is a system whereby replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger)

In contrast to a centralized database, a distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a single (central) point-of-failure.
