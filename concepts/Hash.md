# Hash _(in Computer Science)_

| A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output

The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash digests, digests, or simply hashes.

The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table.

Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.

# Cryptographic hash function (in Cryptography)

A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a hash algorithm (a map of an arbitrary binary string to a binary string with a fixed size of ùëõ bits) that has special properties desirable for a cryptographic application:
