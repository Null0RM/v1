- Cryptocurrency is a term used to describe many types of fungible digital tokens secured using a blockchain. It all started with Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be used to transfer value between two parties without having to trust a middleman. You only have to trust the Bitcoin code, which is all open and freely available.
- The reason assets such as bitcoin and ether are called “cryptocurrencies” is that **the security of your data and assets is guaranteed by cryptography**, not by trusting an institution or corporation to act honestly.
- Ethereum has its own native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), which is used to pay for certain activities on the network. It can be transferred to other users or swapped for other tokens on Ethereum. Ether is special because it is used to pay for the computation required to build and run apps and organizations on Ethereum.
