# Mining _(in Consensus)_

| adds new blocks to the block chain, making transaction history hard to modify

Mining today takes on two forms:

Solo mining, where the miner attempts to generate new blocks on his own, with the proceeds from the block reward and transaction fees going entirely to himself, allowing him to receive large payments with a higher variance (longer time between payments)

Pooled mining, where the miner pools resources with other miners to find blocks more often, with the proceeds being shared among the pool miners in rough correlation to the amount of hashing power they each contributed, allowing the miner to receive small payments with a lower variance (shorter time between payments).

The process of repeatedly hashing a block header while incrementing a https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#nonce until the result contains an arbitrary number of leading binary zeros. This is the process by which new https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#block are added to a proof-of-work blockchain. This was how Ethereum was secured before it moved to proof-of-stake.

a transaction record process with bitcoins to blockchain – the public database of all the operations with Bitcoin, which is responsible for the transaction confirmation. Network nodes use blockchain to differ the real transactions from the attempt to spend the same facilities twice. The main mining objective is reaching a consensus between network nodes on which transactions consider legitimate.
