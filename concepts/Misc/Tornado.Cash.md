- a **non-custodial** **privacy protocol** allowing **permissionless** shielded transactions on Ethereum and derivative networks. **Tornado Cash is not a mixer, as assets are never commingled due to the presence of zero knowledge cryptography**. The core of the protocol is ungovernable and immutable, given Ethereum's distributed state and the provenance of the contracts, they can neither be changed nor tampered with
- achieves anonymity by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses through "anonymity pools". These are immutable smart contracts that accepts fixed denominations of a currency, acting as what is known as a mix network. Although anonymity is only obtained with use of a "relayer", which acts as a withdrawal proxy to mask the link between destination and source addresses.
