## **Creation of coins**

- The creation of coins must be limited for the currency to have value.
- Bitcoins are mined according to set rules, involving solving difficult math problems with adjustable difficulty to maintain a constant rate of solutions. This process is called proof-of-work ([Terms: PoW](https://www.notion.so/Terms-PoW-e9c949cb040b46998874ea342db540b4?pvs=21) ). Miners are rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts, but this reward decreases over time. Eventually, miners will rely on transaction fees paid by users to cover their costs. Malicious blocks that don't follow the rules are rejected by the network. Ultimately, no more than **21 million bitcoins** will ever exist.
