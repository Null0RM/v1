- bundle (or 'roll up') transactions into batches that are executed off-chain.

1. Optimistic Rollup
   - layer 2 (L2) protocols designed to extend the throughput of Ethereum's base layer
   - optimistic rollups derive security from Mainnet by publishing transaction results on-chain, orÂ [plasma chains](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/plasma/), which also verify transactions on Ethereum with fraud proofs, but store transaction data elsewhere

2. ZK Rollup
   - bundle (or 'roll up') transactions into batches that are executed off-chain.
   - A ZK-rollup chain is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is managed by on-chain Ethereum smart contracts. ZK-rollups execute transactions outside of Mainnet, but periodically commit off-chain transaction batches to an on-chain rollup contract
