# Layer1 _(in Blockchain)_

<aside> ðŸ’¡ Layer 1 is the base blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin are both layer 1 blockchains because they are theÂ underlying foundation that various layer 2 networks build on top of.

1. **A network of node operators**Â to secure andÂ validateÂ the network
2. **A network of block producers**
3. **The blockchain**Â itself and the history of transaction data
4. **TheÂ consensus mechanism**Â for the **network**

- Layer 1 is the base blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin are both layer 1 blockchains because they are theÂ **underlying foundation that various layer 2 networks build on top of**.
- All user transaction activity on layer 2 projects can ultimately settle back to the layer 1 blockchain.
- Ethereum also functions as aÂ **data availability**Â layer for layer 2s. Layer 2 projects will **post their transaction data onto Ethereum**, relying on Ethereum for data availability. This data can be used to get the state of the layer 2, or to dispute transactions on layer 2.
- Examples of layer 2 projects include "rollups" on Ethereum and the Lightning Network on Bitcoin.
